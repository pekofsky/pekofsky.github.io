title: The First Version of My Site is Officially Done!
---

## 80 Commits!!!

Putting up this post will be the 80th commit to my repo, meaning the first 79 were to create the version of this site that was visible starting at 10:12AM CDT today.

Super glad to have reached this point, as this is the first time I can say I feel that this site is in a presentable state.

## Looking Forward

I've learned a lot along the way, and I hope to continue learning in adding to this project.

I will be adding more work to my projects page some time soon, and either this, or updates to my resume, are the most likely candidates to be part of my next changes.
