# These are the best of my projects and work for classes


## [US Migration Flows Visualization Project](https://pekofsky.github.io/projects/436proj/)

#### This project explores US migration data from the years 2016 through 2020. All versions also include a link to a hosted shiny app. This project looks much better in HTML format.


## [Exploration of Simulated Student Habits Data](https://pekofsky.github.io/projects/studyhabits/)

#### This project is a brief exploration of a realistic simulated dataset of student habits, and it includes one of my favorite visualizations I have made. Similar to the previous project, this project looks much better in HTML format.
