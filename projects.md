## Getting Started Guide for clubSandwich Interns
[View online](https://pekofsky.github.io/clubSandwichResources/Getting-Started-For-Interns.html)

<div class="collapsible-paragraph">
  <p class="collapsible-text">
    A webpage I wrote and deployed for future clubSandwich interns to utilize. It walks them through the most quick and straightforward ways to quickly get their system(s) set up and get familiar with the basics of R package development. Additionally, it includes details on how to set up GitHub copilot in R Studio, instructions on making a pull request, coding tips, useful resources, and tips based on my own experiences and questions.
    <br><br>
    <u><b>My Contributions:</b></u> This is work from my internship with OSPO, so this page is entirely by me, though it includes links to many external resources.
