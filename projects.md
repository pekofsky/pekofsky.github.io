### These are the best of my projects and work for classes


<h2><a href="/projects/436proj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Migration Flows Visualization Project</a></h2>

#### This project explores US migration data from the years 2016 through 2020. All versions also include a link to a hosted shiny app. This project looks much better in HTML format.


<h2><a href="/projects/studyhabits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploration of Simulated Student Habits Data</a></h2>

#### This project is a brief exploration of a realistic simulated dataset of student habits, and it includes one of my favorite visualizations I have made. Similar to the previous project, this project looks much better in HTML format.


<h2><a href="/projects/2020tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling of Tweets</a></h2>

#### This research paper uses sentiment analysis and topic modeling to investigate tweets surrounding the 2020 presidential election.


<h2><a href="/projects/240proj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC Crime Analysis</a></h2>

#### Statistical Analysis of New York City Crime Data.
