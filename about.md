# <span style="color:blue"> Where am I from? </span>

I was born in New Jersey. When I was 1, my family moved to a Chicago-area suburb, where we lived until I finished elementary school. During middle school and my first two years of high school, we lived in a suburb northwest of LA. For my final two years of high school, I lived in New York City, however, I only had about half a year of properly experiencing the city before Covid-19 lockdowns hit. I then moved on to Madison for my undergrad, and throughout my 4 years studying in Madison, New York has remained the home I've returned to for the summer and other breaks.

# <span style="color:red"> What do I do for fun? </span>

Currently, my most *interesting* hobbies are **bouldering** and **playing piano**, but I have a long way to go in both. On that note, any recommendations for improving at either, especially the former, are always appreciated. Additionally, I spend a lot of my free time in the **gym** and **watching shows**. Currently I am attempting a lean-bulk with the goal of getting slightly bigger and much stronger, and my recent binges are Suits and One Piece. I also really like **cooking**, but I don't mention this as one of my main hobbies because, firstly, *I need to do it*, and second, I <u>hate</u> cleaning up afterwards. I also really like **video games**, in particular, Overwatch 2 and Super Smash Bros Ultimate, though I only infrequently play the latter currently , since the aforementioned pastimes almost always come first.

# <span style="color:green"> Favorite Food(s)? </span>

* Chicken Vesuvio
  * Not nearly as well-known as it should be, cheap, filling, wonderfully flavorful, prepared in bulk, and it gets more delicious each day it sits in your fridge.
* Deep Dish Pizza
  * It only counts if its from a major Chicago-area chain. When people tell me "I don't like deep dish" and I learn that they've never had it **<u>in</u>** Chicago, it irks me, because it's really not the same.
* Detroit Style Pizza
  * Unlike the last item, I've never had it in it's place of origin but I still think it's great.
* Steak
  * Lean cuts only. Sirloin and filet are where it's at. New York strip is also decent.
* Korean Barbecue
  * Shoutout [Let's Meat BBQ](https://www.letsmeatnyc.com/menu/)!
* Baked Ziti
  * Simple and delicious.
  * Also happens to be surprisingly good on pizza. Little Italy Pizza (one of my favorite NYC Pizza Chains) has baked ziti slices, truly the best of both worlds!
* Ramen
  * I love instant ramen, but that's not what I'm referring to.
* Fried Rice
  * During some semesters of college I think I was making large batches roughly twice a week.
