# <span style="color:blue"> Where am I from? </span>

I was born in New Jersey. When I was 1, my family moved to a Chicago-area suburb, where we lived until I finished elementary school. During middle school and my first 2 years of high school, we lived in a suburb northwest of Los Angeles. For my final 2 years of high school, I lived in New York City. However, I only had about half a year of fully experiencing the city before the Covid-19 lockdowns hit. I then moved to Madison for my undergrad, and throughout my 4 years studying in Madison, New York has remained the home I've returned to for the summer and other breaks.

# <span style="color:red"> What do I do for fun? </span>

Currently, my most *interesting* hobbies are **bouldering** and **playing piano**, but I have a long way to go in both, and I always appreciate any recommendations for improving at either. Additionally, I spend a lot of my free time in the **gym** and **watching shows**. As of late, I'm attempting a lean-bulk with the goal of getting slightly bigger and significantly stronger, and my recent binges are Suits and One Piece. I also really like **cooking**, but I don't count this as a hobby because I need to do it. I also enjoy **video games**, in particular, Overwatch 2 and Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

# <span style="color:green"> Favorite Books? </span>

The Great Gatsby, The Little Prince, and Winnie-the-Pooh, in that order.

# <span style="color:yellow"> Favorite Foods? </span>

* Chicken Vesuvio
    * Not nearly as well-known as it should be, cheap, filling, wonderfully flavorful, prepared in bulk, and it gets more delicious each day it sits in your fridge.
* Deep Dish Pizza
    * I’m partial to Chicago-area deep dish; nothing else quite hits the spot for me.
* Detroit Style Pizza
    * I've never had it in its place of origin but I still think it's great.
* Steak
    * Lean cuts are my favorite, especially sirloin and filet. I also enjoy New York strip. On special occasions, I'll appreciate a ribeye as well.
* Korean Barbecue
    * Shoutout [Let's Meat BBQ](https://www.letsmeatnyc.com/menu/)!
* Baked Ziti
    * Simple and delicious and also happens to be surprisingly good on pizza. Little Italy Pizza (one of my favorite NYC Pizza Chains) has baked ziti slices, truly the best of both worlds!
* Ramen
    * Ramen shops are my favorite, but I love instant ramen too.
* Fried Rice
    * I frequently make and enjoy large batches.
